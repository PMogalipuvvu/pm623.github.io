        <h1>Lab 2: Bluetooth</h1>

        <!--<p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>-->

        <h2>Objective</h2>


        <p>The objective of this lab is to establish Bluetooth communication between the Artemis and the computer.
           We need to implement Arduino code on the Artemis side and Python in Jupyter Notebook on the computer. The purpose of this is to offload computation to the computer later when we are performing computationally intensive tasks on the robot.</p>
        
        <h2>Materials and Tools Used </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Sparkfun Artemis RedBoard Nano</li>
            <li>1 USB-C to USB-C Cable</li>
            <li>bluetooth receiver</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        
            <h3>Setup</h3> <br>
              The artemis communicates with the computer using the bluetooth protocol. To facilitate this we use ble python library. We set up a virtual environment to ensure that the libraries installed will not affect other programs. We use jupytter lab to wire and execute python code.<br>
              <br>
            <h3>Bluetooth Connection</h3><br>
                
                To properly establish a connnection to the artemis nano, we need to obtain the MAC address of the Artemis and edit the connection.yaml to reflect this address. <br>
                We can then establish the connection using the ble library. Upon successful connection, we get the below message.

              <h3>Tasks</h3><br>
              <br>          
            <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>ECHO</h3><br>
                For the first task, we need to send a string to the arteemis from jupyter notebook. The artemis should receive the string and append "Robot says -> " to it before sending it back to the computer.
                <br>
                <img src="/img/lab2/ECHO_code_snippet.png" alt="Img">

                In the code snippet, we can see that the artemis appends "Robot says ->" in front of the received string before sending it back to the computer.

              <h3>Send three floats</h3><br>
              For the next task, we beed to send three float values to the artemis, which needs to extract the individual values before printing it.

            <li>
              <h3>Receive float using Notification Handler</h3><br>

              Here, we need to receive a float value from Artemis in Python using the notification handler and update a gllobal parameter using this value. <br>

              To use the notification handler, we need to first define a callback function that is able to convert the byte_array received form the handler to float, updat the global variabe and print the variable. <br>

              Here, we can see that the python program comtinuously receives float values from the Artemis until we call the stop_notify method.

            <li>
              <h3>receive_float() vs recive_string</h3>

              <p>
                
                 In the first approach, python receives the float value as a byte array which is then converted to a float value. In the second approach, pyhton receives the string value as a byte array. We then convert each caracter to its corresponding float value.<br>

                 Both methods are identical functionally. However, recieve_string has the advantage that we can send multiple folat values separated by a delimiter. receive_float can only read one value at a time.
              </p>

            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Effective datarate</h3>

              To calculate the effective data rate, we can send an echo command to the artemis and record the amount of time it takes to receive the response. We know the number of bytes in the message and time taken to send and receive the message, therefore, we can calculate the effective datarate by by dividing the total bytes by total time taken.

              <img src="/img/lab2/effective_datarate.png" alt="Img">

              We can send different lengths of messages to see if the datarate changes.  Here, we send messages with length of 10, 20, 30... 140 characters and measure the effective datarate.

              <img src="/img/lab2/datarate_graph.png" alt="Img">

              From the above graph, we can see that the data rate is not consistent and varies wildly as the length of the string changes,


            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Reliability</h3>

              The artemis is initialy confgured to send the float values at and interval of 0.5s. We can decrease this time intervale to see if there is any loss in data when it is received by the python program.
              
              In the below video, the time interval was reduced to 10ms. We can see the all the data is being received corrctly.

              Further reducing time interval to 1ms does not affect the data received. This suggests that the system is very robust.
