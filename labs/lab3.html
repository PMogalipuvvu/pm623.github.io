        <h2>Objective</h2>


        <p>The objective of this lab is to wire up the sensors (2x TOF and 1xIMU) to the artemis and perform qualitative analysis to test its performance and accurace.
          Additionally we calculate the Pitch, Roll and Yaw using the data measurements from tha IMU

        </p>
        
        <h2>Materials and Tools Used </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Sparkfun Artemis RedBoard Nano</li>
            <li>1 USB-C to USB-C Cable</li>
            <li>2 TOF</li>
            <li>1 IMU</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        
            <h3>3 (A)</h3> <br>

            <h3>Task 1</h3>
              First, we wire up a single TOF and test it using the Wire example. Running this code gives us the address of the sensor. This program only works correctly when a single sensor is connected.
              When two sensors with the same address are connected, the data received will be a random mixture of the readings from the two sensors. By default, the address of the TOF sensor is hardcoded to be 0x52.
              However, the address detected when we run the wire example is 0x29. This is because of a bit shift inherent in i2c communication. <br>

              We then hook up both the TOF sensors by daisy chaining them, taking care to also wire the shutdown port of one of the sensors.

              <br>
            <h3>Task 2</h3><br>
                
                After we properly wire the sensors together, we shutdown on of the sensors using the c program and rewrite the address to something different.
                <br>
                //insert image
                The VL53L1X sensor provides us with 3 differnt ranging modes (short, medium and long).
                
                The short distance mode has its maximum distance limted to 1.3m with a sampline rate of 50Hz. The short distance mode is also insensitive to ambient light. 

                The medium distance on the other hand has a maximum sampling rate of 30 Hz and has a maximum ranging distance of 3m. 
                The long distance mode has a maximum sampling rate of 30 Hz with a maximum ranging distance of 4m.
                
                For the RC car, setting one sensor to long and one sensor to medium would be most effective. One sensor would allow us to detect objects further away while the other one would allow us to accurately map the surroundings.

                <br>
            <h3>Task 3</h3><br>

              We then use the Example1_ReadDistance example to measure the accuracy of the sensors. We shut down one of the sensors and use only a single sensor for out tests.

              To perform out measurements, we affix the sensor to a cardboard box and move the sensor closer to the wall while making measurements with tape as a control.

              Short distance mode has an effective range of about 1.5m while the long distance mode has a larger range. Different textures and colours produced no observable difference in the measurements.
      
              <br>          
            <h3>Task 4</h3><br>

              To enable both the sensors at the same time, we shutdown one of the sensors and reprogram its address to 0x58. Now, we can access the data from both the sensors simultaneously.

            <h3>Task 5</h3><br>

            The TOF sensor uses infrared light to determine the distance information. The IR beam emits a signalm wich is reflected back and detected by the sensor. The time and intensity of the reflected beam is computed to determine the distance to the obstacle.
            
            The cons of such a sensor are cost and low sampling frequency. The pros of a TOF sensor (IR based) are the form factor, and insensitivity to environment.
            
            Amplitude based infrared sensor on the other hand measure the distance using the amplitude of the reflected signals, instead of the time. The pros of such a sensor are cost and package size (form factor). It is however sensitive to environment.

            <h3>Task 6</h3><br>

            Timing budget of a sensor is described as the programmed time needed by the sensor to perform and report measurement data. The TOF sensor data sheet states that the “setTimingBudget” function sets the timing to perform one range measurement. The “setInterMeasurementPeriod” function sets the delay between two ranging operations. Setting the timing budget to a low value will ensure a quicker reading.
            <br>
            Setting the intermeasurement period to a low value will ensure less time between two readings. Since the robot is relatively fast, it would be advantageous to have faster readings so that the environment can be mapped quicker. Therefore, I plan on using a timing budget of 20ms, and a intermeasurement period of 60ms.
