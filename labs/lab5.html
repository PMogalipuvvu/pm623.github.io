        <h1>Lab 5 : Open Loop Control</h1>

        <!--<p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>-->

        <h2>Objective</h2>


        <p>The purpose of this lab is for you to change from manual to open loop control of the car. We connect the motor to the drivers and use a PWM signal generated by the artemis to drive them.
          The car is able to perform preprogrammed actions that are controlled directly using Artemis
        </p>
        
        <h2>Materials and Tools Used </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 RC car</li>
            <li>850mAh LiPo battery</li>
            <li>650mAh LiPo battery</li>
            <li>Artemis Nano</li>
            <li>Motor drivers</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        
            
            <h2>Motor Drivers</h2><br>
            The RC car has two motors, each controlling the wheels on one side of the car. A motor driver (DRV8833 Dual Motor Driver) can drive 2 different motors at the same time. However, to ensure that 
            the motors receive sufficient current to fast, we connect both the channels in parallel, supplying double the current to each motor. We also connect the inputs of the motor 
            driver in parallel

            <br>

            We need to connect the Artemis board to the motor driver inputs to control the speed of the motors. Each motor driver channel needs two inputs which can deliver PWM signals.
            The motor driver also requires two ground inputs, one on the input side which connects to the artemis and one on the output side, which connects to the battery ground.
            
            First, we short out (AOut1, BOut1), (AOut2, BOut2),(AOIt1, BIn1), (AIn2, BIn2) to place both the motor outputs in parallel. Then connect it to the Artemis and use an external powersupply to check that it is outputting
            a clean PWM signal. This driver has an operating voltage of 2.7-10.8V, so when testing on the power supply I the 6V output. The max current froma  single output of the motor driver is 1.2A. However, because we put them in parallel, the effective current 
            avaialble to us is 2.4A, which will let the motor go faster.

            Once we confirm that the wiring is sorrect, we wire the outputs of the motor driver to the motors, while sill powering it on with the power supply. We rotate the wheels forward and backward, and with different PWM duty cycles to check speed control.

            <h2>Assembling the Robot</h2><br>

            Next, we wite the motor drive so that they are powered using the 850mAh battery. Now, we pre program the arduino to perform actions like turning and going straight.

            When the wheels are floating in the air, we need as little as 8% dutycycle (20/255) to turn the wheels. When the wheels are on the ground, we need a higher duty cycle to turn the wheels
